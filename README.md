# Hash Map and Min Heap

Implementations of the hash table and minimum heap data structures using Python.

### Hash Map

Includes 2 simple hash functions and resolves collisions with chaining.

### Min Heap

Implemented using a Dynamic Array functioning as a Priority Queue.

### Helper Structs

Includes implementations of a Dynamic Array and Linked List in Python to help build the functionality for the hash map and min heap data structures.

### Testing

A small test suite is included at the bottom of both hash_map.py and min_heap.py that demonstrates the methods available to each data structure.
